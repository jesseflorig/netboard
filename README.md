# [WIP] Netboard

Digital board to assist in playing complex boardgames

## Routes

The intent is to show the board on a large screen (television or monitor) and control it from a smaller device (phone or tablet). Potentially, multiple players could assist with updating the board state on their personal devices.

 - `/lobby`: Configure the settings for a new game
 - `/board`: Show board state like score, active phase, etc. 
 - `/controller`: Control the board states

 ## Games Supported

*Coming soon*

 -[ ] Twilight Imperium
 -[ ] Arkham Horror
